# Sound
> Analogue signals are continous and are not limited in the amount of values they have, this means they can change as needed 

> Digital signals are discrete so they are limited, and can only change at specified intervals.

> The ____ against time 

## DAC 

> you can convert digital to analogue through a device called DAC, it uses bit patterns which represent the analogue signal and 
> output a variable, analogue, electrical current 

> You can convert an Analogue signal to a Digital signal through a device called an ADC, which takes samples of the analogue signal
> , takes recordings at specified intervals it then records these samples as bit patterns (the samples are measured in herts)



## Bitmapped graphics

> A pixel is the smallest addressable part of a bitmapped image 
> Resolution is given by the amount of pixels in the total image 
> (width * height)


> Sound is the movement of vibrations through a medium 
> sample rate is measured in hertz and is the amount of samples taken per second
> sample resoluton is the amount of bits assigned to each sample 

> nyquists theorem states that the sampling rate of digital audio must be double the frequency
> of the sound otherwise the sound may not be accuratly represented

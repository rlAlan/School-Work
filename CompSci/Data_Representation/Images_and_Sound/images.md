# Images

## Vector and Bitmap: 
- Bitmapped: 
    - Resolution dependant
    <details>
    <summary>
     Composed of pixels
    </summary>

         A collection of pixels to form an image mapped to specific memory locations

         Pixel: the smallest possible addressable area defined by a solid colour
    </details>

    - Always have rectangular background
- Vector:
    -  Made of geometric shapes like lines and curves
    - Resolution independant
    - Have no background
    - inappropriate for realistic images

## Resolutions
<details>
<summary>Image Resolution defenitions: </summary>

    Image Resolution: How many pixels an image contains per inch/cm

    Screen Resolution: the number of pixels per row by the number of pixels per column

</details>

<summary>Resolution calculations</summary>

    pixels per row * pixels per column
    (width * height)
    e.g.
     what is the resolution of a 100 pixel by 70 pixel image:
     100 * 70 = 7000 pixels

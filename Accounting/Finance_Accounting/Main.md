            First Account  
| DR             |            CR |
|----------------|---------------|
| account which gains value or records an asset or expense

            Second  Account

> Debit   Rent Paid 500 <br/>
> Credit  Bank      500 <br/>

>

#### Loan recieved:
> **Debit Bank   account (or cash account)**                          <br/>
> **Credit loan  account ** <br/>
